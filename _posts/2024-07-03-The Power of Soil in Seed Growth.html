    <p>Zebra Cactus (Haworthia Fasciata) is a stunning succulent known for its distinctive white stripes and rosette-shaped foliage. Native to South Africa, this resilient plant is favored by succulent enthusiasts for its low maintenance and unique appearance. Proper care is essential to ensure your Zebra Cactus thrives and remains healthy for years to come.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Zebra Cactus Needs</h2>
    <p>Before diving into care tips, it's important to understand the natural habitat and needs of Zebra Cactus:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Light Requirements:</strong> Zebra Cactus thrives in bright, indirect light. Place it near a window with filtered sunlight or in a location where it receives several hours of indirect sunlight daily.</li>
        <li><strong>Temperature:</strong> These succulents prefer moderate temperatures between 65-80째F (18-27째C). Protect them from extreme heat or cold drafts, especially during winter.</li>
        <li><strong>Watering:</strong> Zebra Cactus is drought tolerant but requires occasional watering. Allow the soil to dry out completely between waterings, especially in winter when growth slows.</li>
        <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining succulent or cactus mix to prevent waterlogged soil, which can lead to root rot. A mix with perlite or coarse sand promotes good drainage.</li>
        <li><strong>Fertilization:</strong> Feed sparingly with a diluted succulent fertilizer during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing during winter when the plant is dormant.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Care Tips for Zebra Cactus</h2>

    <h3>1. Lighting</h3>
    <p>Provide adequate light for healthy growth:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Place indoor plants near south or west-facing windows for optimal light exposure.</li>
        <li>Rotate the plant periodically to ensure even light distribution and prevent etiolation.</li>
        <li>Monitor for signs of sunburn (brown or white spots) and adjust light intensity accordingly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Watering</h3>
    <p>Establish a watering routine that suits Zebra Cactus' water needs:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water thoroughly when the soil is dry, typically every 2-3 weeks during the active growing season (spring and summer).</li>
        <li>Reduce watering frequency to once a month or less during winter dormancy, allowing the soil to dry out completely between waterings.</li>
        <li>Avoid overwatering, as Zebra Cactus is prone to root rot in soggy conditions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Temperature and Environment</h3>
    <p>Ensure suitable temperature and environmental conditions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Maintain temperatures between 65-80째F (18-27째C) year-round, avoiding sudden temperature fluctuations.</li>
        <li>Protect plants from cold drafts and extreme heat, which can stress the succulent.</li>
        <li>Provide adequate ventilation to prevent humidity buildup, which can lead to fungal diseases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Repotting and Maintenance</h3>
    <p>Periodically repot Zebra Cactus to refresh the soil and encourage healthy growth:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Repot every 2-3 years or when the plant outgrows its current container.</li>
        <li>Choose a slightly larger pot with good drainage, using fresh succulent soil to support root development.</li>
        <li>Trim dead or dried-out leaves with sterile scissors to maintain a tidy appearance and promote new growth.</li>
    </ul>
