<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Light:</strong> The Zebra Cactus thrives in low light conditions, making it an ideal plant for indoor spaces that do not receive direct sunlight. Place your Zebra Cactus near a window with filtered light for best results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Watering:</strong> One of the key care tips for the Zebra Cactus is to avoid overwatering. Only water the plant when the soil is completely dry, typically every 2-3 weeks. Ensure that the pot has good drainage to prevent root rot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Soil:</strong> Use a well-draining cactus or succulent mix for your Zebra Cactus. A mix of potting soil and perlite or sand works well to provide the plant with the proper drainage it needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Temperature:</strong> The Zebra Cactus prefers temperatures between 65-80°F (18-27°C). Keep the plant away from drafts or extreme temperature fluctuations to prevent stress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Humidity:</strong> This plant thrives in average indoor humidity levels. You do not need to provide any additional humidity for the Zebra Cactus to thrive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Fertilize the Zebra Cactus sparingly, using a diluted cactus fertilizer once a month during the growing season (spring and summer). Avoid fertilizing during the dormant winter months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Repotting:</strong> The Zebra Cactus does not require frequent repotting. Repot the plant every 2-3 years or when it has outgrown its current pot. Choose a slightly larger container with good drainage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pests and Diseases:</strong> The Zebra Cactus is relatively pest-resistant but may be susceptible to common succulent pests like mealybugs or spider mites. Keep an eye out for any signs of pests and treat them promptly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pruning:</strong> The Zebra Cactus does not require pruning, as it maintains a compact and symmetrical shape on its own. Remove any dead or yellowing leaves to promote healthy growth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Propagation:</strong> Propagate the Zebra Cactus through offsets or division. Simply separate the offsets from the mother plant and plant them in a separate container with well-draining soil.</p>
</li>
