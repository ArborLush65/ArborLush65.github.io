    <p>Zebra Cactus (Haworthia Fasciata) is a resilient succulent known for its striking appearance and ease of care. However, like any plant, it can encounter problems that affect its health and growth. Understanding common issues and knowing how to address them can help you maintain vibrant and thriving Zebra Cactus plants in your collection.</p>

    <h2>Identifying Common Problems</h2>
    <p>Several common issues may affect Zebra Cactus:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Overwatering:</strong> One of the most common issues for succulents, including Zebra Cactus, is overwatering. Symptoms include yellowing or translucent leaves, soft or mushy stems, and root rot.</li>
        <li><strong>Underwatering:</strong> Insufficient watering can cause Zebra Cactus leaves to shrivel or become wrinkled. The plant may also appear limp or droopy despite being in well-lit conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Lighting Issues:</strong> Incorrect light exposure can lead to sunburn, where Zebra Cactus leaves develop brown or white spots. Insufficient light may cause elongation of stems (etiolation) as the plant stretches toward light sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Pest Infestations:</strong> While Zebra Cactus is generally resistant to pests, mealybugs and spider mites can occasionally affect these plants. Look for cottony white clusters or webbing on leaves and treat promptly.</li>
        <li><strong>Disease:</strong> Fungal infections such as leaf spots or root rot can occur if the plant is exposed to excessive moisture or poor air circulation.</li>
        <li><strong>Improper Potting:</strong> Using pots without drainage holes or inappropriate soil mixes can lead to waterlogged soil and root suffocation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Solve Zebra Cactus Problems</h2>

    <h3>1. Overwatering</h3>
    <p>To address overwatering issues:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allow the soil to dry out completely before watering again.</li>
        <li>Check the roots for signs of rot and trim affected parts if necessary.</li>
        <li>Repot the Zebra Cactus in well-draining soil and a pot with drainage holes.</li>
        <li>Adjust your watering schedule to water less frequently, especially during winter dormancy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Underwatering</h3>
    <p>If your Zebra Cactus is underwatered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gradually increase watering frequency, ensuring the soil is moist but not waterlogged.</li>
        <li>Provide adequate light to encourage healthy growth and prevent dehydration.</li>
        <li>Mist the plant occasionally to increase humidity levels, especially in dry indoor environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Lighting Issues</h3>
    <p>To correct lighting problems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move the Zebra Cactus to a location with filtered sunlight or indirect light to prevent sunburn.</li>
        <li>Rotate the plant periodically to ensure even light distribution and prevent etiolation.</li>
        <li>Use sheer curtains or blinds to filter intense sunlight during the hottest part of the day.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Pest Infestations</h3>
    <p>If pests are present:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Inspect the plant regularly for signs of pests such as mealybugs or spider mites.</li>
        <li>Isolate affected plants to prevent the spread of pests to other succulents.</li>
        <li>Treat infested plants with insecticidal soap or neem oil, following product instructions carefully.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Disease Management</h3>
    <p>If your Zebra Cactus shows signs of disease:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Prune affected leaves or stems using sterilized tools to prevent the spread of infection.</li>
        <li>Improve air circulation around the plant by spacing it away from other plants.</li>
        <li>Apply a fungicide if necessary, following recommendations for succulents and cacti.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preventive Care Tips</h2>
    <p>Prevent problems before they occur with these tips:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Choose the Right Pot:</strong> Use pots with drainage holes and well-draining soil to prevent waterlogged conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Environmental Conditions:</strong> Keep an eye on temperature, humidity, and light levels to provide optimal growing conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Practice Good Hygiene:</strong> Clean pots and tools before use to prevent the spread of pests and diseases.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe Regular Maintenance:</strong> Trim dead leaves, remove debris, and repot as needed to maintain plant health.</li>
    </ul>
